# Graphs
* A tree is a graph
* a tree is a connected graph without cycles
* graphs can be directed or undirected
* might be multiple isolated subgraphs. 
  * If there is a path bewteen every pair nodes in a subset, then that is a "connected component"
  * If from every node, you can reach every other node --> Fully connected
* **Acyclic Graph** 
  * One without cycles

## Two ways to represent a graph
### Adjacency List
### Adjacency Matrix
