Coding challenges

This is a complication of the material i have used to prepare for coding challenges.

This repository is broken into sections
1. C++ overview
2. Data Structures
3. Dynamic Programming
4. Alogrithms (coming soon)
5. Staging area for questions that are waiting to be sorted



It is organized into the basic topics used in coding interviews:
1. C++ topics
* * General information about C++ language
2. Data Strucres
* * The C++ standard libraries for data structrues and implementations of them
* * Any file ending in "- from C++_com" means it is a reference from http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/ to quickly check functions and usage for that standard library data structure
3. Dynamic Programming and Recursion
* * DP and Recursion were harder topics for me to grasp for i gave them their own category
* * In this folder, you will find recursive, memoization and tabular solutions to common DP problems
4. Staging-not complete
* * This consists of coding challenges I have done but have not organized into one of the above categories yet.


## Note
* * Not all of the projects run. Some of them are based off HackerRank implementations.
* * This is not robust, refined or complete yet. 
* * All notes are typed up by me




For the purpose of interview studying

* Data Structures
* Alogrithms
* Big O Notation
* C++ Fundamentals
    * 


Algorithms
* BFS, DFS
* Traversals
* Recursion
* Binary earch

Sort
* insertion, selection, merge sort
* quicksort, count sort, heap sort

Cracking the code interview topics:
0. Big O Notation
1. Arrays and strings
2. Linked Lists
3. Stacks and Queues
4. Trees and Graphs
5. Bit Manipulation
6. Math and Logic puzzles
7. Object Oriented Design
8. Recursion and DP
9. System design and scalability
10. Sorting and Searching
11. Testing
12. C and C++
16. Moderate problems
17. Hard problems
XI. Advanced Topics

Basic Core questions
* heaps vs stack
* alias vs pointers
* classes and structs
* char *s
